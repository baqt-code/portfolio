# Machine Learning in Data Analysis: From KNN to Real-World Applications

As a software developer with hands-on experience in machine learning, I've worked on various projects that demonstrate the practical applications of ML algorithms in solving real-world problems. This post explores insights from implementing K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), wine quality prediction models, and retail data analysis systems.

## Project Overview

My recent work involved developing three distinct machine learning projects:

1. **KNN Algorithm Implementation**: Building a classification system from scratch
2. **Wine Quality Prediction**: Applying ML to assess wine characteristics
3. **Retail Data Analysis**: Analyzing sales patterns and customer behavior

## K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Implementation

### Algorithm Foundation

KNN is a simple yet powerful algorithm that makes predictions based on the similarity of data points. Here's my implementation approach:

```python
import numpy as np
from collections import Counter
import pandas as pd

class KNearestNeighbors:
    def __init__(self, k=3):
        self.k = k
        self.X_train = None
        self.y_train = None
    
    def fit(self, X, y):
        """Store training data"""
        self.X_train = X
        self.y_train = y
    
    def euclidean_distance(self, point1, point2):
        """Calculate Euclidean distance between two points"""
        return np.sqrt(np.sum((point1 - point2) ** 2))
    
    def predict(self, X_test):
        """Make predictions for test data"""
        predictions = []
        
        for test_point in X_test:
            # Calculate distances to all training points
            distances = []
            for i, train_point in enumerate(self.X_train):
                dist = self.euclidean_distance(test_point, train_point)
                distances.append((dist, self.y_train[i]))
            
            # Sort by distance and get k nearest neighbors
            distances.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
            k_nearest = distances[:self.k]
            
            # Extract labels of k nearest neighbors
            k_labels = [label for _, label in k_nearest]
            
            # Make prediction based on majority vote
            prediction = Counter(k_labels).most_common(1)[0][0]
            predictions.append(prediction)
        
        return predictions
```

### Performance Optimization

Key optimizations implemented:

- **Vectorized Operations**: Using NumPy for efficient distance calculations
- **Memory Management**: Optimizing data structures for large datasets
- **Cross-Validation**: K-fold validation for robust performance assessment

```python
# Cross-validation implementation
def cross_validate_knn(X, y, k_values, cv_folds=5):
    results = {}
    
    for k in k_values:
        fold_accuracies = []
        
        # Perform k-fold cross-validation
        for fold in range(cv_folds):
            # Split data into training and validation sets
            X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(
                X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=fold
            )
            
            # Train and evaluate model
            knn = KNearestNeighbors(k=k)
            knn.fit(X_train, y_train)
            predictions = knn.predict(X_val)
            
            # Calculate accuracy
            accuracy = np.mean(predictions == y_val)
            fold_accuracies.append(accuracy)
        
        results[k] = {
            'mean_accuracy': np.mean(fold_accuracies),
            'std_accuracy': np.std(fold_accuracies)
        }
    
    return results
```

## Wine Quality Prediction Model

### Data Preprocessing Pipeline

Wine quality prediction required comprehensive data preprocessing:

```python
# Wine quality data preprocessing
class WineQualityPreprocessor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.scaler = StandardScaler()
        self.label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
    
    def preprocess_data(self, df):
        """Comprehensive data preprocessing"""
        # Handle missing values
        df = self.handle_missing_values(df)
        
        # Feature engineering
        df = self.engineer_features(df)
        
        # Normalize features
        feature_columns = df.select_dtypes(include=[np.number]).columns
        df[feature_columns] = self.scaler.fit_transform(df[feature_columns])
        
        return df
    
    def handle_missing_values(self, df):
        """Handle missing values using domain knowledge"""
        # Fill missing values with median for numerical features
        numerical_columns = df.select_dtypes(include=[np.number]).columns
        df[numerical_columns] = df[numerical_columns].fillna(
            df[numerical_columns].median()
        )
        
        return df
    
    def engineer_features(self, df):
        """Create new features based on domain knowledge"""
        # Acidity ratio
        df['acidity_ratio'] = df['fixed_acidity'] / df['volatile_acidity']
        
        # Alcohol-to-sugar ratio
        df['alcohol_sugar_ratio'] = df['alcohol'] / (df['residual_sugar'] + 1)
        
        # pH categories
        df['ph_category'] = pd.cut(df['pH'], bins=3, labels=['Low', 'Medium', 'High'])
        
        return df
```

}
```

## Retail Data Analysis Project

### Customer Segmentation

Implemented customer segmentation using clustering algorithms:

```python
# Customer segmentation analysis
class CustomerSegmentation:
    def __init__(self):
        self.kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=4, random_state=42)
        self.pca = PCA(n_components=2)
    
    def segment_customers(self, df):
        """Perform customer segmentation"""
        # Feature engineering for segmentation
        customer_features = self.create_customer_features(df)
        
        # Perform clustering
        clusters = self.kmeans.fit_predict(customer_features)
        
        # Add cluster labels to dataframe
        df['customer_segment'] = clusters
        
        return df, customer_features
    
    def create_customer_features(self, df):
        """Create features for customer segmentation"""
        customer_metrics = df.groupby('customer_id').agg({
            'purchase_amount': ['mean', 'sum', 'count'],
            'days_since_last_purchase': 'mean',
            'product_category': 'nunique'
        }).reset_index()
        
        # Flatten column names
        customer_metrics.columns = [
            'customer_id', 'avg_purchase', 'total_spent', 
            'purchase_frequency', 'avg_days_between_purchases', 
            'category_diversity'
        ]
        
        return customer_metrics
```

### Sales Forecasting

Developed time series models for sales prediction:

```python
# Sales forecasting implementation
class SalesForecaster:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = None
        self.scaler = MinMaxScaler()
    
    def prepare_time_series_data(self, df, lookback_window=30):
        """Prepare data for LSTM model"""
        # Sort by date
        df = df.sort_values('date')
        
        # Create sequences
        X, y = [], []
        for i in range(lookback_window, len(df)):
            X.append(df.iloc[i-lookback_window:i]['sales'].values)
            y.append(df.iloc[i]['sales'])
        
        return np.array(X), np.array(y)
    
    def build_lstm_model(self, input_shape):
        """Build LSTM model for sales forecasting"""
        model = Sequential([
            LSTM(50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=input_shape),
            Dropout(0.2),
            LSTM(50, return_sequences=False),
            Dropout(0.2),
            Dense(25),
            Dense(1)
        ])
        
        model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse', metrics=['mae'])
        return model
```
